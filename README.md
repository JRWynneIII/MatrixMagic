MatrixMagic
===========

A scalable, CUDA accelerated set of linear algebra functions

This library is designed to make working with matricies and vectors simpler for the programmer. Simply `#include` the `matrixMagic.h` header file and use `-L ./lib` and `-lMatrixMagic` and they will provide you with access to the `Matrix` class and various other functions.

So far, this provides the user with:
* The `Matrix` object. You use this for both matricies and vectors, just specify which dimension is of size 1 with `.setMatrix`
  - `.transpose()` will transpose your matrix or vector for you
  - `.readMatrix()` provides you with a simple way to read in a matrix from a file into the object
  - `.setMatrix()` allows you to define a 1 or 2 dimensional array ***on the heap*** and pass it and the dimensions into the object
  - `.getMatrix()` will return a pointer to the internal double array. For the sake of simplicity, all 2 dimensional matricies are stored as a 1 dimensional array inside the object.
  - `.getX()` will return the size in the X dimension (i.e. number of columns)
  - `.getY()` will return the size in the Y dimension (i.e. number of rows)
  - `.isVector()` is used to query the object whether the matrix is a vector or not. This will return `true` if it is a vector and `false` if it isn't
  - `.empty()` will delete the internal `double` array
  - `.LUDecomp()` will factor the matrix inside the object using LU Decomposition
* Also provided is a simple to use `multiply()` function. This can be used to do Matrix * Vector or Vector * Vector operations. Also supported is multiplication of 2 square matrices

And many more functions/features are in the works including a Conjugate Gradient routine.

As of now, all functions and objects are defined inside the main header file. This will be changed in the future to be more like a typical C++ library.

To recompile the MatrixMagic shared library, simply run:
```
$ make
```

To compile all the tests, run:
```
$ make tests
```
